GoBike System Data

Dataset

This dataset includes all information relating Baywheel Trip’s Subscribers and Customers individual bike trips. This dataset is available for public usage and was taken from Lyft’s website

Summary of Findings

In general, Subscribers make more trips than Customers but with shorter duration. As the weather gets to the extremes, the number of trips decreases. Namely, there is a least amount of trips in June and most during October but level out afterward. Start time of the trip doesn’t affect the duration of the trip. Finally, the weekends see a decreased number of trips compared to the weekday. This could be explained as during the weekdays, people bike to work. 

Key Insights for Presentation

Taking into account the number of trips based on the months could help companies reduce cost by making less bikes available. Increasing the numbers of bikes during the weekdays could also prove beneficial.
